<p>H5NET is designed to work in any transport layer that is capable of handling packet payloads of up to 400 bytes, with <em>any</em> amount of packet loss and connection instability. As such, it performs no verification of player identity, but it is fairly trivial to extend it to do such a thing. It <em>should</em> be impossible to write a compliant, sane packet that exceeds 400 ASCII characters/bytes in length, however there is plenty of room to expand until the more realistic 1000+ bytes that most protocols can handle, which leaves rooms for extensions to touch this specification.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the &#x201C;.h5net&#x201D; extension for H5NET documents (where applicable). H5NET is identified by the MIME type <code>text/h5net</code></p>
<h3>H5NET is a specification for racing game communication</h3>
<hr />
<p>When querying the node that is acting as the server or &#x2018;MASTER&#x2019;, the following format should be followed:</p>
<h3>CLIENT NODE FORMAT:</h3>
<pre><code>_USER
    id (identification) ...

_DATA
    exten (ext)
    _DATA_(id)
        thrusters (thru1) (thru2) (buttons)

_QUERY
    mode (mode)</code></pre>
<p>Where (identification) is the desired player number(s) to control, however the client node may not request more than 4.</p>
<p>Where (ext) is the extension the client wants to use. The client should be prepared to roll back to basic &#x2018;Halfive&#x2019; if the server does not reply in the expected format of the extension.</p>
<p>Where (thru1) is the value of the left thruster axis, (unsigned, 8-bit)</p>
<p>Where (thru2) is the value of the right thruster axis (unsigned, 8-bit)</p>
<p>Where (buttons) is a bitmask holding the state of eight buttons (unsigned, 8-bit)</p>
<p>Where (mode) is one of the letters described below</p>
<h4>CLIENT NODE MODES:</h4>
<p>r - RACE INFORMATION l - LEADERBOARD INFORMATION</p>
<hr />
<p>The server should reply to the IP address (or closest equivalent at the implementation&#x2019;s discretion, in case the protocol used is not IP) following this template:</p>
<h3>MASTER NODE FORMAT:</h3>
<pre><code>_DATA
    track (trackname)
    game (gamemode)
    ext (extension)
    1 (pos1) (pos2) (t1) (t2) (t3)
    2 (pos1) (pos2) (t1) (t2) (t3)
    3 (pos1) (pos2) (t1) (t2) (t3)
    4 (pos1) (pos2) (t1) (t2) (t3)
    6 (pos1) (pos2) (t1) (t2) (t3)
    7 (pos1) (pos2) (t1) (t2) (t3)
    8 (pos1) (pos2) (t1) (t2) (t3)</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Where (trackname) is an eight character alphanumerical string that represents the track being used.</p>
<p>Where (gamemode) is an eight character alphanumerical string that represents the gamemode being used. To indicate a normal race mode, it should be &#x201C;_DEFAULT&#x201D;</p>
<p>Where (pos1) and (pos2) are a the x and y of the player&#x2019;s position (unsigned, 32-bit, origin (0,0)), and t1-3 are the flags described below.</p>
<p>Note these flags are abstract and meant to give the client context, as opposed to any kind of computationally-specific indications. If the flag &#x2018;r&#x2019; is received as the client packet mode, race type 1, race type 2, and race type 3 flags shall be supplied. If the flag &#x2018;l&#x2019; is received, the leaderboard information should be supplied at (t1) flag, and the other two types should not be included.</p>
