<h1>Half-World Network Specification</h1>
<h4>SPDX identifier: COIL-1.0</h4> 
<h4>Please read the HWPACK and HWDOC specifications before this one.</h4>
<h4>The HWDOCs (TOML) represented here are only for the sake of clarity. Everything should be send over the network in a minified HWPACK (JSON) format equivalent to the smallest possible conversion of HWDOC.</h4>
<h4>HWNET is designed to work in any transport layer that is capable of handling packet payloads of up to 400 bytes, with <em>any</em> amount of packet loss and connection instability. As such, it performs no verification of player identity, but it is fairly trivial to extend it to do such a thing. It <em>should</em> be impossible to write a compliant, sane packet that exceeds 400 ASCII characters/bytes in length, however there is plenty of room to expand until the more realistic 1000+ bytes that most protocols can handle, which leaves rooms for extensions to touch this specification.</h4>
<h4>It is recommended to use the &#x201C;.hwnet&#x201D; extension for HWNET documents (where applicable).</h4>
<h4>HWNET is identified by the MIME type <code>text/hwnet</code></h4>
<h3>When querying the node that is acting as the server or &#x2018;MASTER&#x2019;, the following format should be followed:</h3>
<h3>CLIENT NODE FORMAT:</h3>
<hr />
<pre><code>[user]
id=[&quot;(identification)&quot; ...]

[data]
    exten=[&quot;(ext)&quot;]
    [data.(identification)]

[query]
    mode=[&quot;(mode)&quot;]</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Where (identification) is the desired player number(s) to control, however the client node may not request more than 4. where (ext) is the extension the client wants to use. The client should be prepared to roll back to basic &#x2018;HalfWrld&#x2019; if the server does not reply in the expected format of the extension.</p>
<p>Where (thru1) is the value of the first thruster axis Where (thru2) is the value of the second thruster axis Where (steer) is the value of the steering axis</p>
<p>Where (mode) is one of the letters described below</p>
<h4>CLIENT NODE MODES:</h4>

<h3>The server should reply to the IP address (or closest equivalent at the implementation&#x2019;s discretion, in case the protocol used is not IP) following this template:</h3>

<hr />
<p>Where (trackname) is an eight character alphanumerical string that represents the track being used. Where (gamemode) is an eight character alphanumerical string that represents the gamemode being used. To indicate a normal race mode, it should be "_DEFAULT"</p>
<p>Where (pos1) and (pos2) are a 2D representation of that player&#x2019;s vehicle position, and t1-3 are the flags described below.</p>
<p>Note these flags are abstract and meant to give the client context, as opposed to any kind of computationally-specific indications. If the flag &#x2018;r&#x2019; is received as the client packet mode, race type 1, race type 2, and race type 3 flags shall be supplied. If the flag &#x2018;l&#x2019; is received, leaderboard information should be supplied in an additional parameter (t4), and the other three should be left as empty strings.</p>
