Half-World Node Common/Communication Specification [WORKING DRAFT]

THIS IS THE FIRST SPECIFICATION, BUT STILL TECHNICALLY REFERRED TO AS AN EXTENSION, AND OFFICIALLY HAS THE ID 'HalfWrld'. THIS ID IS RESERVED AND MAY BE TREATED AS INDICATIVE OF THE BASIC SPECIFICATION INDICATED IN THIS DOCUMENT.

THIS SPECIFICATION DEFINES NO SPECIFIC BEHAVIOUR OTHER THAN HOW DIFFERENT Half-World Nodes MUST COMMUNICATE TO ENSURE TECHNICAL COMPATIBILITY. THIS SPECIFICATION DOES NOT ENSURE THE SUBJECTIVE OR OBJECTIVE QUALITY OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFENT Nodes, OR ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION. IT IS VERY LIKELY THIS SPECIFICATION WILL BE SUPERSEDED BY AN EXTENSION NAMED 'Half-World Base Implementation Guidelines', WITH ID 'HalfImpl', THAT WILL BE COMPLETELY BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE. HOWEVER, SUCH EXTENSION DOES NOT YET EXIST. THIS ID IS RESERVED AND SHOULD, UNTIL THE SPECIFICATION IS RELEASED AND THIS SECTION IS SUBSEQUENTLY REVISED, BE SPECIFICALLY IGNORED AND NEVER ACCEPTED AS A VALID EXTENSION FOR A Node TO ACTIVELY USE.

DEFINITIONS (D0)


Half-World Common Specification (HWCOMM): This document

Half-World Track (HWT): Defines an encoding format for Tracks

CommonUnit (CU): An arbitrary number meant to be a common unit for all relative sizes.

Stage: 2D plane where all of the gameplay takes place, that is a maximum of 8000000 (8 MILLION) CUs wide and long.

Track: Racing Circuit that follows the Half-World Track encoding specification (HWT). It has its first segment anchored on an arbitrary position on the Stage, and has a size from the interior to exterior line of (5+WIDTH)*1000 CommonUnits.

Player: Entity (Be it NPC or Human) that sends the required inputs to action an HV.

HoVercar (HV): Vehicle of rectangular shape that has a variable position on the Stage, is 300CUs wide and 600CUs long, and is controlled by a Player. It has two thrusters, one on the rear right, and another on the rear left, that dictate how it should move.

Input: A set of two onedimensional numbers that represent the relative position of each of each thruster lever of an HV.

GameMode: Set of rules compliant with the Half-World GameMode encoding specification (HWGM).

Race: The act of the Player or Players competing in a Track, on a Stage, controlling HVs, following a GameMode.

Node: Software that carries out the logic of the race, with its own implementation of the specification.

Server: The node that, in a race that involves multiple nodes, will be the ultimate authority on the state of the Race, and its results.

Client: The node(s) that, in a race that involves multiple nodes, may execute the race by themselves (though it is not always recommended since physics can vary between implementations), but must periodically sync up with the Server.


Extension: Arbitrary modifications to HWT, HWGM, HWCOMM, and any new specifications that are considered relevant. In order to identify which Nodes implement them, they shall be named HW_EXT_XXXXXXXX, where "XXXXXXXX" is an arbitrary, unique 8-character alphanumerical string (A-Z,a-z,0-9)

-----------------------------------------


RACE INITIATION PROCEDURE (S0)

Client (S1): the Client queries the Server for the following information:

T0 - The size (Height, Width) of the Stage.

T1 - The Track information, with HWT encoding, and where on the Stage the Track is anchored.

T2 - The GameMode information, with HWGM encoding.

T3 - After replying to [S2.T0], query how many HVs there are, the starting position of each HV/Player (both physically on the track and their initial position points-wise), and which of these Players the Client has control over.

T4 - After replying to [S2.T1], query which Extensions the Client will use.

T5 - Query the starting position of any GameMode-specific objects.

T6 - After replying to [S2.T2], query which team the Client is in.

TX0    -    //YOU MAY, ON YOUR OWN VERSION OF THIS DOCUMENT, ADD YOUR Extention-SPECIFIC PROCEDURES

TX1    -    //YOU MAY, ON YOUR OWN VERSION OF THIS DOCUMENT, ADD YOUR Extention-SPECIFIC PROCEDURES


Server (S2): the Server queries the Server for the following information:

T0 - Query how many Players/HVs the Client needs, and only then reply to [S1.T3].

T1 - Query which Extensions the Client supports, and only then reply to [S1.T4].

T2 - Query wether the Client requests to be on any specific team or doesn't care, and only then reply to [S1.T6].
