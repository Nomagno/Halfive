Half-World Document Specification (The encoding syntax HWGM and HWT)

HWDOC is a dead simple subset of TOML

The only things supported are comments, arrays of strings, and there is no top level table and only support for one subtable level.


---------------------------------

#THERE IS NO TOP LEVEL TABLE

[table]

[table.1]

#ONLY ARRAYS OF STRINGS ARE SUPPORTED
name = ["john", "doe"]
age = ["5", "fwive"]
verboseage = ["fwive", "5"]
foo = ["bar"]

[table.2]

ageofjohn = ["five", table.1.age] 
# This is the same as ["five", "5", "fwive"]

---------------------------------

Anything else not seen here is not supported. This includes nested arrays, nested tables, integers, etc.
