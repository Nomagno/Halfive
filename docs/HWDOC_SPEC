Half-World Document Specification (The encoding syntax HWGM and HWT)

HWDOC is a dead simple subset of TOML

The only things supported are comments, arrays of strings, and there is no top level table and only support for one subtable level.


There can be no single table name, string or key name longer than 20 characters. This restriction, however, does not apply when referencing objects with dot syntax ("yes2 = [my14charstable.6table.yes]").

Aditionally, arrays can not be longer than 20 elements.

There can, aditionally, not be more than 100 tables, or 500 key-value pairs (where a value is an array of arbitrary length).

---------------------------------

#THERE IS NO TOP LEVEL TABLE

[table]

[table.1]

#ONLY ARRAYS OF STRINGS ARE SUPPORTED
name = ["john", "doe"]
age = ["5", "fwive"]
verboseage = ["fwive", "5"]
foo = ["bar"]

[table.2]

ageofjohn = ["five", table.1.age] 
# This is the same as ["five", "5", "fwive"]

---------------------------------

Anything else not seen in this document is not supported. This includes nested arrays, nested tables, integers, etc.
