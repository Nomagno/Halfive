The .hwt (Half-World Track) format has a very template that must always be followed:

------------------------------------------
[PARAMETERS]

PARAM - VALUE
PARAM - VALUE
PARAM - VALUE

[SEGMENTS]

(itr) (p1x, p1y) (p2x, p2y) (p3x, p3y) (w)

# OR

(itr) (p1x, p1y) (p2x, p2y) (p3x, p3y) (w) + PARAM = VALUE
------------------------------------------

EXPLANATION:

Empty lines and lines starting with hashtag "#" will be ignored. Whitespace does matter.
Always start the file with the "[PARAMETERS]" header, followed by flags/settings following 
the "PARAM - VALUE" format, of course replacing PARAM and VALUE for the parameter and the value.
After the "[PARAMETERS]" section comes the [SEGMENTS] section. Here you define the segments like so:

"(itr) (p1x, p1y) (p2x, p2y) (p3x, p3y) (w)"

Where p1 and p2 are bezier curve anchors, p3 is a bezier curve control point, 
itr is the number of the segment, and w is the track width 0.0 to 10.0

Aditionally, you can add special properties for that segment:

"(itr) (p1x, p1y) (p2x, p2y) (p3x, p3y) (w) + PARAM = VALUE"
