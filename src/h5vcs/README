Halfive Version Control System
A lightweight 50-line sh VCS that uses patch and diff

For safety reasons, h5vcs.sh will not delete files, 
and will simply empty the contents of files deleted 
from one commit to the other. I recommend using the
following POSIX sh function to delete empty files after 
running the commmand:
h5vcs(){ h5vcs.sh $@; find tree -empty -exec rm {} +; }


Usage:
h5vcs.sh [OPTION] [ARG]
-n   New project, ARG - path of info file to copy
-c   Create new commit, ARG - path of info file to copy
-r   Rollback to commit, ARG - index
-i   Show info about commit, ARG - either "REPO" or the index
-h   Print this message



Layout of a repo:

PROJECT_ROOT
"-- .h5vcs
|   |-- commits
|   |   |-- 0.patch
|   |   |-- 0.info
|   |   |-- 1.patch
|   |   |-- 1.info
|   |   "-- .......
|   "-- info
"-- tree
    "-- PROJECT_FILES

Where commits are named linearly counting up from zero
Where 'N.info' indicates the description of commit N
Where the format for the '.h5vcs/info' file is the following:
NAME
LASTCOMMIT
SHORTINFO
LONGINFO


NAME - One line, name of the project
LASTCOMMIT - One line, index of last commit or 'NONE'
SHORTINFO - One line, information about the project
LONGINFO - Until end of file, information about the project
