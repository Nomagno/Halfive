Utility to POST a pair of 'analog' (0-100) HTML slider values to a server. 
Makes for a great improvised controller for Half-World implementations.
USAGE: 
  - Serve the HTML file
  - The server now receives POST URL-encoded at the URL '/post'
  - The format of the sent data is "pos1=INT&pos2=INT", where INT is a number from 0 to 100.

halfive-term will read input data from the last line of a specified ASCII plain text file (can be a FIFO) in the format INT,INT,INT,INT,BOOL,BOOL,BOOL,BOOL where each one of the four INTs is an axis, from 0 to 65535, and each one of the four BOOLs is a digital button, 0/1
It is designed to work with just the two first axis being being active, and no buttons
