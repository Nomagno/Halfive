Implementation of interfaces in the '/include/halfive' folder

Implemented headers:
h5doc.h (Tokenizer of H5DOC format) (PENDING REIMPLEMENTATION TO BE CHILD-LINKED)
h5vm.h (Virtual machine compliant with H5VM)
h5elq.h (Transpiler to H5VM compliant with H5ELQ Lisp) (PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION, ONLY PARSER)
h5asm.h (Assembler for H5VM)
h5vi.h (Abstraction over graphics, input, and sound)
h5stdlib.h (Partial freestanding standard library replacement)
h5rat.h (Rational number handling)
h5math.h (Math utilities) (PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION)

Pending implementation:
h5t.h (Track encoder/decoder, wrapper over h5doc.h, EASY)
h5net.h (Packet encoder/decoder, wrapper over h5doc.h, EASY)
(h5rpg.h, h5rpg_proto.h) (Turn-based battle engine, EASY)
h5phy.h (Arcade racing physics engine, VERY HARD)

The following headers should be used on the caller side:
halfive/h5phy.h (For using all specified interfaces except those in h5vi.h)
halfive/h5vi.h (Might require porting to each target)

Back of the envelope calculations suggest that (depending on preprocessor macros used to conditionally enable excessively heavy features),
the memory footprint of the (backend part of the) engine will range in the best-case scenario from around 10KBs to around 800KiBs. It is reasonable to expect
a maximum memory footprint (sound and graphic backends aside, but taking into account the display and network buffers and code) of
4-12MiBs when VM simulation is enabled.

Run the command `make` or `make main` to compile to a static library/archive file
Run the command `make remain` to clean and compile to a static library/archive file

Run the command `make h5asm` to get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler'
Run the command `make reh5asm` to clean and get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler'

Run the command `make h5asm_debug` to get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler_debug', which has more detailed ouput
Run the command `make reh5asm_debug` to clean and get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler_debug', which has more detailed ouput

You can use `make INCLROOT="/path/to/include/halfive/"` to change the default path of the folder with the headers
Available macros (use `make PARAMS="-DMACRO1 -DMACRO2"`)
(not setting any of these makes for a headless/nodependency build):

H5VI_GSERV_IMPL_FOO - Enable H5VI graphics server implementation foo (Probably ***REQUIRES*** external dependencies)
H5VI_AUDIOSERV_IMPL_FOO - Enable H5VI audio server implementation foo (Probably ***REQUIRES*** external dependencies)
H5VI_STDINPUT_IMPL_FOO - Enable H5VI input server implementation foo (Probably ***REQUIRES*** external dependencies)
H5VI_TEST - Enable entry point for example H5VI program (***REQUIRES*** external dependencies) (***ENTRY POINT***)
H5PHY_VM_SIMULATION - Most memory consuming option, enable doing per-player H5VM simulation. If not set, h5vm.h is not available in h5phy.h
H5ASSEMBLY - Enable assembler frontend (***REQUIRES*** stdio.h) (***ENTRY POINT***)
H5ASM_VERBOSE - Enable verbose output for assembler frontend
FLOATS_SUPPORTED - Floats are available on the target (***REQUIRES*** the 'float' type to exist)
