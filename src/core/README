Implementation of interfaces in the '/include/halfive' folder

Implemented headers:
h5doc.h (Tokenizer of H5DOC format)
h5vm.h (Virtual machine compliant with H5VM)
h5elq.h (Transpiler to H5VM compliant with H5ELQ Lisp) (PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION, ONLY PARSER)
h5asm.h (Assembler for H5VM)
h5vi.h (Abstraction over graphics, input, and sound)
h5stdlib.h (Partial freestanding standard library replacement)
h5rat.h (Rational number handling)
h5math.h (Math utilities)

Pending implementation:
h5t.h (Track encoder/decoder, wrapper over h5doc.h, EASY)
h5net.h (Packet encoder/decoder, wrapper over h5doc.h, EASY)
(h5rpg.h, h5rpg_proto.h) (Turn-based battle engine, EASY)
h5phy.h (Arcade racing physics engine) [DEPRECATED]

The following headers should be used on the caller side:
halfive/h5vi.h (Might require porting to each target)
(MORE TO COME)


Run the command `make clean` to clean up all extra files generated by previous `make` commands
Run the command `make` or `make main` to compile to a static library/archive file
Run the command `make remain` to clean and compile to a static library/archive file

Run the command `make h5asm` to get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler'
Run the command `make reh5asm` to clean and get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler'

Run the command `make h5asm_debug` to get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler_debug', which has more detailed ouput
Run the command `make reh5asm_debug` to clean and get a binary for the assembler called 'h5assembler_debug', which has more detailed ouput

Run the command `make pamview` to get a binary for the PAM image viewer called 'pamview', which also supports viewing tileset information

You can use `make INCLROOT="/path/to/include/"` to change the default path of the folder with the headers
Available macros (use `make PARAMS="-DMACRO1 -DMACRO2"`)
(not setting any of these makes for a headless/nodependency build):

H5VI_GSERV_IMPL_FOO - Enable H5VI graphics server implementation foo (Probably ***REQUIRES*** external dependencies)
H5VI_AUDIOSERV_IMPL_FOO - Enable H5VI audio server implementation foo (Probably ***REQUIRES*** external dependencies)
H5VI_STDINPUT_IMPL_FOO - Enable H5VI input server implementation foo (Probably ***REQUIRES*** external dependencies)
H5VI_TEST - Enable entry point for example H5VI program (***REQUIRES*** external dependencies) (***ENTRY POINT***)
H5VI_IMAGE_VIEWER - Enable entry point for PAM format tileset viewer (***REQUIRES*** external dependencies) (***ENTRY POINT***)
H5PHY_VM_SIMULATION - Most memory consuming option, enable doing per-player H5VM simulation. [H5PHY.h IS DEPRECATED]
H5ASSEMBLY - Enable assembler frontend (***REQUIRES*** stdio.h) (***ENTRY POINT***)
H5ASM_VERBOSE - Enable verbose output for assembler frontend
FLOATS_SUPPORTED - Indicates the implementation supports floating point numbers (***REQUIRES*** the float type to exist). Required for the full game, but might be optional in specific submodules
