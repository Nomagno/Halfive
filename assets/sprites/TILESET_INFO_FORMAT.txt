The .info tileset info format:

MULTIPLETILES
TILE_HEIGHT - height of a single tile
TILE_WIDTH  - width of a single tile
HEIGHT      - height of the tileset in tiles
WIDTH       - width of the tileset in tiles
PADDING     - how many pixels are used as padding between tiles (image edges excluded)

After this, the labelling of all tiles follows.
Each row starts on a separate with a tag for the kind of tiles it contains.
This may be one of:
	- SYMBOL
	- SPRITE
	- IMAGE
	- Something else entirely, but preferrably uppercase
Each line then contains the plaintext names every symbol in the row, in order.
The names must not be longer than 31 characters.


A .info file that only contains one tile can have the following format:

SINGLETILE
TAG name

Where TAG is the tag of the symbol (see above), and name is its name.

Finally, a sole line ends every .info tileset info file:

ENDINFO

Everything after this is considered a comment.
A .info file must have the same name as the corresponding .pam tileset (5x5.pam -> 5x5.info)
