HALF-WORLD, THE UNIVERSAL RACING GAME PROTOCOL

Half-World is a stateless protocol for racing games, and with a bit more work any 2D game that needs to be accessible, lightweight, and work under heavy/total packet loss.

Half-Five (src folder) is a modular implementation of a racing game that adheres to Half-World.
It has a lot of C utility interfaces, such as:
- HWT/HWNET reader (WIP)
- Portable VM and assembly language
- Small object-oriented macro header
- UUIDv4 implementation
- Declarative physics engine (WIP)
- Arbitrary-viewport ASCII 2D renderer (WIP)
- Terminal frontend to tie it all together (WIP)

It has no implementation requirements

List of specifications and corresponding mime types:
	Encoding formats:
		Half-World Document (HWDOC)
			- text/hwdoc

	Domain-specific data formats:
		Half-World Network (HWNET)
			- text/hwnet
		Half-World Track (HWT) 
			- text/hwt

	General-purpose tools:
		Half-World Virtual Machine (HWVM)
			- text/hwvm
			- application/hwbin
			- application/hwdrive

If you read all specifications in the docs, you should be able to:
 - Use HWNET as a basic communications standard
 - Use HWT as a basic format for circuits
 - Use HWVM as a basic runtime for user-generated content

You can make your own extensions of these documents.
To make them valid extensions, simply specify inside them an 8-character alphanumerical name (underscore hyphen 0-9 A-Z a-z, e.g "_My-Ext2").
