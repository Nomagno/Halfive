HALF-WORLD, THE UNIVERSAL RACING GAME

Half-World is a stateless protocol for racing games, and with a bit more work any 2D game that needs to be accessible, lightweight, and work under heavy/total packet loss.

Half-Five (src folder) is a modular no-dependency implementation of a racing game that adheres to Half-World.
It has a lot of C utility interfaces, such as:
- HWDOC reader (src/core/hwdoc.h)
- HWNET/HWT reader (WIP) (src/core/hwnet/hwnet.h) (src/core/hwt/hwt.h)
- Portable VM and assembly language (src/core/hwvm/hwvm.h)
- Portable abstraction over graphics, sound, and input backends (stc/core/hwvi.h)
- Declarative physics engine (WIP) (src/core/halfive.h)
- Arbitrary-viewport ASCII 2D renderer (WIP)

It has no implementation requirements

List of specifications and corresponding mime types:
	Encoding formats:
		Half-World Document (HWDOC)
			- text/hwdoc

	Domain-specific data formats:
		Half-World Network (HWNET)
			- text/hwnet
		Half-World Track (HWT)
			- text/hwt

	General-purpose tools:
		Half-World Virtual Machine (HWVM)
			- text/hwvm
			- application/hwbin
			- application/hwdrive

If you read all specifications in the docs, you should be able to:
 - Use HWNET as a basic communications standard
 - Use HWT as a basic format for circuits
 - Use HWVM as a basic runtime for user-generated content

To make them extensions easily trackable, I recommand specifying inside them an 8-character alphanumerical name (underscore hyphen 0-9 A-Z a-z, e.g "_My-Ext2").
