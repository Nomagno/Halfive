HALF-WORLD, THE UNIVERSAL RACING GAME PROTOCOL

Half-World is a stateless protocol for racing games, and with a bit more work any 2D game that needs to be accessible, lightweight, and work under heavy/total packet loss.

Half-Five (src folder) is a modular implementation of a racing game that adheres to Half-World. 
It has a lot of C utility interfaces, such as:
- HWT/HWNET reader
- Portable VM and assembly language
- Small object-oriented macro header
- UUIDv4 implementation
- Declarative physics engine (WIP) 
- Arbitrary-viewport ASCII 2D renderer (WIP)
- Terminal frontend to tie it all together (WIP)

All you need to implement it is a JSON parser, a TOML parser, and some kind of network capability (Can be UDP, TCP, Bluetooth, or IP over Avian Carriers. HWNET is cross-protocol-proxy friendly!).

List of specifications and corresponding mime types:
	Encoding formats:
		Half-World Packet (HWPACK) (JSON subset) -- text/hwpack
		Half-World Document (HWDOC) (TOML subset) -- text/hwdoc

	Domain-specific data formats:
		Half-World Network (HWNET) (Uses HWPACK) -- text/hwnet
		Half-World Track (HWT) (Uses HWDOC) -- text/hwt

If you read all specifications in the docs, you should be able to:
 - Use HWPACK/HWNET as a basic communications standard
 - Use HWDOC/HWT as a basic format for circuits

You can make your own extensions of these documents. 
To make them valid extensions, simply specify inside them an 8-character alphanumerical name (underscore hyphen 0-9 A-Z a-z, e.g "_My-Ext2").
